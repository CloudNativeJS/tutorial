## Welcome from Red Hat!

Red Hat is excited to be back at [NodeConf.eu](https://www.nodeconf.eu/)! We'll be demonstrating a few of our favorite production-quality tools and solutions, all designed to help teams maintain productivity while successfully navigating the vast and rapidly changing cloud-native landscape.

## Developing Cloud Native Node.js Applications

This workshop provides an introduction to cloud native development with Node.js. The workshop will walk you through building cloud native Node.js applications, including demonstrating typical components that form part of the Red Hat and IBM Node.js Reference Architecture. Next, weâ€™ll take you through a full stack deployment on Kubernetes. The workshop will cover key cloud native concepts and technologies, including health checks, metrics, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana.
