# Building a CRUD REST API with Node.js

## Introduction

// TBD: Tutorial Introduction

## Installing Express

The following steps cover creating a base Express.js application. Express.js is a popular web server framework for Node.js.

1. Create a directory to host your project:

   ```sh
     mkdir node-crud-api
     cd node-crud-api
   ```

2. Initialize your project with `npm` and install the Express.js module:

   ```sh
     npm init -y
     npm install express
   ```

3. It is important to add effective logging to your Node.js applications to facilitate observability, that is to help you understand what is happening in your application. The [NodeShift Reference Architecture for Node.js](https://github.com/nodeshift/nodejs-reference-architecture/blob/main/docs/operations/logging.md) recommends using Pino, a JSON-based logger.

   Installing Pino:

   ```sh
     npm install pino
   ```

4. Now, let's start creating our server. Create a file named `server.js`:

   ```sh
   touch server.js
   ```

5. Add the following to `server.js` to produce an Express.js server that responds on the `/` route with 'Hello, World!'.

   ```js
   const express = require('express');
   const pino = require('pino')();
const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     pino.info(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

Start the application by running `node server.js` and then navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the server respond with 'Hello, World!'. You can stop your server by entering CTRL + C in your terminal window.

## Defining Routes

// TBD: Introducing chapter

Create the required CRUD api routes using the following steps:

1. Create a new file called `routes.js` and initialize a new express router:

   ```js
   const express = require('express');

   const router = express.Router();
   ```

2. Register the CRUD api routes to the router:

   ```js
   router.get('/todos', (req, res) => {
     res.json({
       message: 'Not yet implemented!'
     });
   });

   router.post('/todos', (req, res) => {
     res.json({
       message: 'Not yet implemented!'
     });
   });

   router.put('/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
     res.json({
       message: 'Not yet implemented!'
     });
   });

   router.delete('/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
     res.json({
       message: 'Not yet implemented!'
       
     });
   });

   router.delete('/todos', (req, res) => {
     res.json({
       message: 'Not yet implemented!'
     });
   });
   ```

3. Default export the created express router:

   ```js
   module.exports = router;
   ```

4. Install two additional NPM packages needed for handling cors and parsing the request's body:

   ```sh
   npm install body-parser cors
   ```

   and then, register the packages as express middleware right before the `/` route declaration in the `server.js` file:

   ```js
   const cors = require('cors');
   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

   ...

   app.use(cors());
   app.use(bodyParser.json());
   app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

   ...
   ```

   > If you want to learn more about CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">here</a>.

5. Register the exported router as an express route right after the middleware registration in the `server.js` file:

   ```js
   const apiRoutes = require('./routes');

   ...

   app.use('/api', apiRoutes);

   ...
   ```

The `server.js` should look like this:

```js
const express = require('express');
const pino = require('pino')();
const app = express();
const cors = require('cors');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const apiRoutes = require('./routes');

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.use('/api', apiRoutes);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  pino.info(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Restart the server, navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/todos and you should see the server response `{ message: 'Not yet implemented!' }` presented in JSON format.

## Data persistence logic

// TBD: Introducing chapter

Create a persistent layer for the todos and update the express routes following these steps:

1. Create a global `todos` array inside `routes.js`:

   ```js
   let todos = []; // this is our in-memory persistence layer
   ```

2. Use pino as the logger:

   ```js
   const pino = require('pino')();
   ```

3. Implement the `GET /todos` route:

   ```js
   router.get('/todos', (req, res) => {
     res.json(todos);
   });
   ```

4. Implement the `POST /todos` route:

   ```js
   router.post('/todos', (req, res) => {
     const author = req.body.author;
     const task = req.body.task;

     if (!task || !author) {
       res.status(422).send("Unprocessable Entity");
       return;
     }

     const id = todos.length;

     const todo = {
       id,
       author: author,
       task: task
     };

     todos.push(todo);

     res.json({
       success: true,
       message: 'Todo successfully added!',
     });
   });
   ```

5. Implement the `PUT /todos/:id` route:

   ```js
   router.put('/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
     const { id } = req.params;
     const task = req.body.task;

     pino.info(`Attempting to update a todo by ID (${id})`);
     todos = todos.map((t) => t.id === id ? task : t);

     res.json({
       success: true,
       message: 'Updated todo ${id}'
     });
   });
   ```

6. Implement the `DELETE /todos/:id` route:

   ```js
   router.delete('/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
     const { id } = req.params;
     todos = todos.filter((t) => t.id !== id);

     res.json({
       success: true,
       message: 'Todo has been deleted'
     });
   });
   ```

7. Implement the `DELETE /todos` route:

   ```js
   router.delete('/todos', (req, res) => {
     todos = [];

     res.json({
       success: true,
       message: 'Deleted todos data'
     });
   });
   ```

Starting the server and using CURL we can test our API:

1. Create a new todo:

   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/todos -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"author": "nodeshift", "task": "Learn Node.js"}'
   ```

2. Get all the todos from the server:

   ```sh
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/todos
   ```

   ```
   [
     {
       "id": 0,
       "author": "nodeshift",
       "task": "Learn Node.js"
     }
   ]
   ```

## Validating inputs

Any input that is passed to the API should be validated before it is used. This is important
because using invalid inputs within your application could lead to failures and even worse
may be crafted by an attacker to cause your application to do something unintended or return
more information than you planned. A good example of this is
[SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection).

Try running:

```shell
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/todos -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"author": "nodeshift", "tasaxk": "Learn Node.js"}'

```

You'll notice that `task` is mispelled as `tasaxk` and from the output you can see that the request was rejected:

```shell
< HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
```

That is because we had added validation in the post method:

```
  const author = req.body.author;
  const task = req.body.task;

  if (!task || !author) {
    res.status(422).send("Unprocessable Entity");
    return;
  }
```

This was straight forward because the input was simple. For more complex APIs you may want to use
a JSON validator such as [ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv). It is also something that using OpenAPI
and API-First tools help with.


## Hardening headers with Helmet

Security is everyoneâ€™s responsibility. Express Helmet secures your Node.js application from some obvious threats. While writing a Node.js Express application, you can use Helmet to safeguard your application from usual security risks like XSS, Content Security Policy, and others.

Enable the `helmet` express middleware by following the steps:

1. Install helmet plugin with NPM:

   ```sh
   npm install helmet
   ```

2. Register helmet as the **first** express middleware in `server.js`:

   ```js
   const helmet = require('helmet');

   ...

   app.use(helmet());
   ```

By using the `helmet()` middleware like this we are enabling the following helmet <a href="https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet#reference">options</a>:

- contentSecurityPolicy
- dnsPrefetchControl
- expectCt
- frameguard
- hidePoweredBy
- hsts
- ieNoOpen
- noSniff
- permittedCrossDomainPolicies
- referrerPolicy
- xssFilter
